      <h1>Planning and Brainstorming</h1>
      <h2>Brainstorming Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>We all wanted to make a simple to understand website that could be navigated easily</li>
        <li>What we did was we made a google doc and started to add all of the tables as a rough draft to see how it would look</li>
        <li>We distributed the work by everyone doing their own, someone working on home page, someone working on brainstorming/planning page and the last person will do the CSS.</li>
        <li>We feel most proud of the CSS, we were able to make everything look as we imagined.</li>
        <li>What we found the most difficult was the CSS which is why it made us the most proud, a lot was going not as we expected but we found out how to fix it.</li>
      </ol>

        <li>DNA was Digitized. It is written in binary as a way to remember what it means in DNA. It will be stored in a database shortly after.</li>
        <li>The goal was to store DNA in computers for a long period of time so it can be used at a later time. Police cases or in finding the cure for deadly diseases</li>
        <li>Police can benefit from this and scientists since police can use it in their databases and scientists can use it in trying to find a cure for diseases
        The people whose DNA was used are in danger since it can be hacked and ransomed back to a person. Digitized DNA can be planted at crime scenes to incriminate the person who has that DNA.</li>
        <li>Our world is worse because of Digital Representation. There are a lot of benefits for day to day life of having all this technology. Being able to have DNA saved digitally helped many police cases and to help cure diseases. It can be used in worse ways to ransom people with their own DNA, it can also be used to incriminate someone by planting DNA at crime scenes. Digital DNA is barely protected and can be hacked easily. Our world will slowly get worse and worse because of Digital Representation</li>

        <li>The unique tattoo's from NBA players are being digitilized on to there character models in the NBA 2k game.</li>
        <li>The purpose is to add tattoos to the character model so it looks more like the basketball player.</li>
        <li>The benefits is that the the baskestball players models look more realistic and accurate to the actual players.	</li>
        <li>The tattoo artist who made the tattoos don't get any pay from there art being put in the game.</li>
      </ol>
      <center><h4>Cesar's Answers</h4></center>
        <ol>
          <li>The actors’ likeness is being digitized using CGI to make models of the person’s face.</li>
          <li>The purpose was to have actors play parts in movies/shows even if they are deceased.</li>
          <li>The filmmakers are benefitting because they are able to get actors to play parts in their film. The viewers are being harmed because many people would not like to see a dead person in the film, and the family members could disapprove.</li>
          <li>The world is worse because of digitization since, in this case, the filmmakers could even have people unwilling to play in their movies, still appear in it using CGI.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
       <p>we will all start with our own pages and after will do the home page, then add the planning page while someone does the css. Once all of that is done we will add the annotated articles into each individual page</p>
